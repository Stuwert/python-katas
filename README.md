# Python Code Practice

This is my repo for practicing Python using [Code Wars](http://www.codewars.com).

## Practices

  - Next Square
    - Takes an integer as an input.  Returns the next square if the integer input is a square.  Returns -1 otherwise.
  - Who Likes
    - Takes a list of names and returns a string that declares who "likes" a specific item.
